    // You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble 
    // fitting them into the time constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities!
    // So you write a program to do it for you.

    // The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.
    // Each session contains multiple talks.
    // Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish by 12 noon, for lunch.
    // Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.
    // The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.
    // No talk title has numbers in it.
    // All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).
    // Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.

    // Note that depending on how you choose to complete this problem, your solution may give a different ordering or combination of talks into tracks.
    // This is acceptable; you don't need to exactly duplicate the sample output given here.

    // The application should be able to load a textfile with all the tracks at once.

    // Test input:
